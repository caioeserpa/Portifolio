        See http://www.JSON.org/

        The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
        It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
        headers, Cookies, and CDL.

        This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
        in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
        then, choose carefully.

        The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
        not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
        package.</l:description><l:license name='The JSON License' url='http://json.org/license.html'/></l:dependency></l:dependencies>
